## 🎓 How Perplexity Sonar Works

Unlike traditional LLMs that rely solely on training data, Perplexity's **Sonar model**:

1. **Searches the live web** in real-time
2. **Aggregates multiple sources** (MoveBuddha, PODS, Moving.com, etc.)
3. **Synthesizes current information** (2025 pricing, not 2023)
4. **Provides citations** (verifiable sources)
5. **Updates continuously** (not static training data)

**This is NOT hallucination - it's real web search!**
